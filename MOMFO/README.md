MOMFO (Multi-opbjective multi-factorial optimization)
=====================================================

## Overview  

This repository is for the back up of my program.
This program is for the evolutionary multi-objective multi-tasking optimization (EMOMT).  If you want to know about it in detail,  please read the reference. 

This program is the extension of Jmetal, which is the open source-code of evolutionary multi-objective optimization. If you find any bugs in my source code, please be free to contact to me via an e-mail. 

## Requirement
These program is coded in Java.
So, if you want to use this program, please install java.
